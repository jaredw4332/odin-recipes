    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The recipe begins with a blending of flour with spices, followed by coating
        the wings in the mixture, and then refrigerating them. While waiting, you
        must create the sauce which will cover the spice blend, using hot oil and 
        a mixture of butter, hot sauce, and other spices.
        After 60-90 minutes, the now coated wings must be fried in oil for 10 to 15
        minutes. When the timer is up, the wings must be added with the hot sauce 
        mixture into a bowl and stirred together. Then, they may be served.</p>
